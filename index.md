## About Me

I am currently a PhD student in computer science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Dan Williams](https://people.cs.vt.edu/djwillia/). where my academic spread broadly in operating systems and cloud systems. Before joining Virginia Tech. Quanzhi obtained his master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke & Duke Kunshan University and Bachelor's degree at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen

I fortunately had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. [John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/) and Ms. [Yiwei Lyu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yiweilyu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I also worked with Dr. [Yi Chen](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/chenyi) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. before starting my Ph.D. study. My research interests include Cloud System and Operating System.
